                    <p>It is important to speak to your landlord or housing association to confirm you are able to keep a cat at home. Cats Protection will need written confirmation from them that this is the case.</p>
                    <p>If you are not allowed cats as part of your tenancy agreement, there may be ways to reassure your landlord that you’d be a responsible cat owner and look after their property. For more information, visit our Purrfect Landlords campaign. </p>
