                    How can I adopt a cat with Cats-4-Lyf?
                </header>
                <p>Adopting a cat with Catz-4-Lyf is a three-step process. First, you'll need to find a cat in your local area using our <em>Cat</em>alogue. Then, you'll be contacted by someone from your local branch or centre. They'll take you through the process of meeting the cat and adopting them.</p>
                <p>Alternatively, you can visit one of our centres with no appointment. Our centre staff and volunteers can discuss what you're looking for and help you choose the right cat for you. You can find out more about choosing a cat in our guide.</p>

                    I live in a flat or small building. Can I still adopt a cat?
                </header>
                <p>If you live somewhere with minimal access to the outdoors, you may still be able to adopt a cat. Cats that have to remain indoors for health issues such as poor vision or Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) still make great companions.</p>
                <p>Some older or more timid cats can often live as an indoor cat very successfully. There are products that can be used to screen windows so that you can safely provide your cat with fresh air. Remember to never let your cat out onto a narrow ledge or balcony, as heights are a risk for all animals.</p>

                    I can't seem to find any cats to adopt on the website. What can I do?
                </header>
                <p>We have thousands of cats and kittens coming into our care every day that need homes, but some of them might not be featured on the website yet.</p>
                <p>If you can't find a cat to suit you, get in touch with your local branch or centre. They'll be able to tell you about any cats that might have recently come into care, but have yet to be advertised.</p>

                    Can I adopt a cat if I live in rented accommodation?
                </header>
                <p>It is important to speak to your landlord or housing association to confirm you are able to keep a cat at home. Cats Protection will need written confirmation from them that this is the case.</p>
                <p>If you are not allowed cats as part of your tenancy agreement, there may be ways to reassure your landlord that youâ€™d be a responsible cat owner and look after their property. For more information, visit our Purrfect Landlords campaign. </p>
